            </div>

            <p>They say that the good die young, well and if that is the case, than I am one
               bad motherf*****. I have managed to battle through so much and still manage to
               make the most of it. Saying that I have lived a life that is different than the 
               average child would be me lying. So let me tell you a little bit about me.

               <h3>The Young Boman's</h3>
            </div>

            <p>Growing up in my household was unfortunately pretty average but on the better end.
               My family was a broken home, my parents were divorced before I was born, and yes that
               mean I was a little late night accident, but none the less I was undeniably the child 
               of both of my young parents. My mother came from the background of a true broken household
               were she never knew her dad and her mother was a very eccentric human being, that last part
               is still debatable from what I hear, and she unfortunately pasted away before I was born
               due to cancer. So momma bear was quite broken over my grandmother passing which any young
               parent with two children at this point totally would make someone kinda fall into bad habits
               and hang out with bad people. My father was rised by a military man and a Georgia girl,
               and with a house that was so strict and tight, it's hard for someone to not be quite
               a defiante kid.

               <h3>The Evolution</h3>
            </div>

            <p>Being raised by two very much so loving but very young and very much so kids raising kids.
               Mind you I wouldn't change anything I went through because every moment taught me extremely 
               valuable. One thing was that I was a stuborn kid who definately has to learn things the hard
               way most of the time to be able to fully understand every aspect of the situation. So that means
               no matter how many times they told me to watch who I hung out with and what I did to others, so I may 
               have started partying soon after that thinking that I wouldn't be the one to do the stupid shit... well
               I ate those words a bit later from that.

               <h3>The Life</h3>
            </div>

            <p>My first party was freshman year of highschool, back in the era that "booty bashing" was a thing.
               Basically when the girl would twerk for hours straight with every guy, whom just found out what their
               thing between their legs is, trying to get behind them. It was just kids being kids at that age so you
               already know that everyone worried about who was who with what money and a huge popularity contest. I never
               fell in the crowd of popular kids, which quite honestly I was absolutely fine with, I could watch my anime
               and be a weirdo right on by myself. But the parties was just an adrenaline rush that got me to break out of
               the normal which was what kept me going to the parties. Of course the older we get the more we are willing
               to risk while we are still able to risk it. We found out about the lovely liquid courage that we would
               always manage to sneak it from one of the friends parents through various means, and then me and my friends
               started being the people to host/throw the parties. Boy let me tell that is when things started to change.

               <h3>The Haze</h3>
            </div>

            <p>We became one of the people to go to when people wanted to party. It became so addicting that wether we 
               wanted to party that weekend or not, we would definately need to be ready to go by Friday right after school.
               We play every party game and drink any sort of liquid we could possibly get our hands on so we learned very quickly
               not to be stengy with what we got. We started doing the dumb shit that kids do especially one's with so much
               confidence such as hosting parties at other peoples houses and grabbing a laundry basket or a mattress and sliding
               down the stair case putting a hole in the wall. To throwing a party that was the talk of about three different large
               highschools, where hundreds of kids was moving throughout the whole house for 8 hours straight. From breaking railings
               to jumping off of the balcony to breaking the TV in the living room to beating up the kid who hit his girlfriend so we picked
               him up and threw him out of the front door. Every weekend just started blending together when your life is constantly
               a movie scene, but piecing together all of the memories and videos and pictures of the night to be able to hold dearly.

               <h3>The Lesson</h3>
            </div>

            <p>Putting that kind of damage on a body that isn't fully developed yet has a strong chance to effect me in a negative
               way, which unfortunately has managed to catch up to me already at such a young age. The memories will live with me for 
               the rest of my life. Through everything I have learned so many important traits that I will carry with me, some of them is 
               becoming a listener, being empathetic, never discriminating, and being able to bring the best in people out of them. Those values
               mean more to me than some of the core traits my parents even taught me but are still very closely tied to what they were trying
               to get across to me. It just took years of learning thing the hard way for me to fully understand and view every aspect.
